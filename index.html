            <h2 id = "interests">Interests</h2>
                <p>Outside of the classroom, I like to stay active and involved in my community. I play for Wreck, Georgia Tech's Ultimate Frisbee Team and travel to play in tournaments against other teams. I also enjoy giving back to the community as a shift leader for The Campus Kitchen Project, a non-profit organization that donates food to students in need or local food banks. Moreover, I love being part of Kappa Alpha Theta Fraternity, an empowering group of girls involved in STEM and community service. With this organization, I volunteer to raise money for Court Appointed Special Assoicates (CASA) through fundraisers.</p>
                <p>When I have the time, I also enjoy playing the violin and traveling. This past Spring semester I had the opportunity to study abroad in France! Also, I enjoy learning new skills such as programming in different languages and about mechatronics such as the Arduino and Raspberry Pi that I believe will allow me to adapt to the evoloving STEM workplace.</p>


            <h2 id = mysilverlining>Work in Progress</h2>
                <p>Although my 2020 Summer internship with Canon Virginia as a manufacturing engineer intern was canceled due to unforseen circumstances, I believe there has been a silver lining to this. This summer I am taking the time to explore my interests, learn new skills, and work on exciting projects! I am currently researching the development of a vehicle simulation framework and flight safety modeling using machine learning for a couple of professors at Georgia Tech. Moreover, I am working on a robotic arm project with an Arduino, utilizing my Java skills to create a couple of programs, and learning about HTML and CSS!
